# redmine-palywright

This NPM package helps users programmatically execute some of the UI operations of Redmine. The goal is to provide a way to automate testing and other manual tasks which Redmine does not currently provide APIs for, although this will change as the time goes on, i.e. more APIs will be added later.

redmine-palywright provides methods for the following Redmine features:

- Creating/deleting authentication modes
- Archiving/unarchiving projects
- Create trackers
- Create issue custom fields
- Get the list of installed plugins
- (plus a few more methods for UI operations)
